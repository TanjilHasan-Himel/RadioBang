# 🎵 Radio Bang — Online Radio + Blog

**Live streaming, music search, blog & experiments with SEO.**  
A personal passion project by [Tanjil Hasan Himel](https://github.com/tanjilhasan-himel) — built as a fun time-pass, but with real technical depth.  

I’m a **CSE student** who enjoys mixing creativity, code, and media. This project is my way of learning & experimenting while building something that feels like a *real product*.

📌 Note

This is primarily a learning project — part fun, part passion, part portfolio.
I believe coding + media can create something powerful, and this project is my small attempt to do that.
